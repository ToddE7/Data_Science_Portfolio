Currently I have two projects included:
1. Sentiment analysis on lines from various literature sources. I have two separate approaches, the first is a manually implemented efficient perceptron. The second is an LSTM neural network using Tensorflow.
2. Binary classification on Kaggles newer space titanic dataset. I used this as a way to learn XGBoost decision tree ensemble models. I also used hyperparameterization to find the best parameter set.
