This project was for the Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) to predict if someone was teleported off the space Titanic. I used it as a place to learn XGBoost. I first created a very standard model without modifying variables, then used hyperparameterization to find a more ideal model. Using these hyperparameter model I was able to achieve top 30% on the leaderboard.
